During reconaissance phase or when doing OSINT , we often use google dorking and shodan and thus the idea of Dorkish. <br>
Dorkish is a Chrome extension tool that facilitates custom dork creation for Google and Shodan using the builder and it offers prebuilt dorks for efficient reconnaissance and OSINT engagement.
